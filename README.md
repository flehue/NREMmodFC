# NREMmodFC
Wilson-Cowan implementation for the testing of NA and ACh FC modulation hypotheses.

Abstract: 
Awake brain dynamics are maintained by various wake-promoting mechanisms, particularly the neuromodulators Acetylcholine (ACh) and Noradrenaline (NA), whose levels naturally decrease during the transition to sleep. The interaction between these neurotransmitters and their combined influence on brain connectivity during NREM sleep stages remains unclear. Previous models have considered the effects of these neurotransmitters, but typically in isolation or only during deep sleep. In this study, we employ a Whole Brain model to investigate how changes in brain neurochemistry during NREM sleep, specifically involving ACh and NA, affect functional brain connectivity. Using a Wilson-Cowan whole brain model informed by an empirical connectome and a heterogeneous receptivity map of neuromodulators, we explore these dynamics. Initial Functional Connectivity analysis reveals distinct connectivity changes: a decrease in Locus Coeruleus (LC) connectivity with the cortex during N2 and N3, and a decrease in Basal Forebrain (BF) connectivity with the cortex during N3. Additionally, compared to W, there is a transition to a more integrated state in N1 and a more segregated state in N3. We examine this phenomenon using a biophysical model, adjusting global coupling and local input-output slope parameters for ACh and NA, respectively. When these parameters vary heterogeneously based on BF or LC priors, the model's fit to all stages FC improves, demonstrating that the region-specific distribution of these neurotransmitters is crucial for explaining their effects on brain Functional Connectivity. This work enhances our understanding of neurotransmitters' roles in modulating sleep stages and their significant contribution to brain state transitions between different states of consciousness, both in health and disease.
